Artificial Intelligence,Software,Project CodeNet,"There are a few differentiating features of Project CodeNet when compared to other similar efforts. In addition to the size of the dataset, the code samples are written in over 50 programming languages, though the dominant languages are C++, C, Python, and Java. The code samples in Project CodeNet are annotated with a rich set of information, such as the code size, memory footprint, CPU run time, and status, which indicates acceptance or error types. Over 90% of the problems come with the respective problem description, which contains a concise problem statement, specification of the input format and the output format. When available, we also extracted from the problem description sample input and output, and provide them as part of the dataset. Users can execute the accepted codes samples (over 50% of the submissions are accepted) to extract additional metadata and verify outputs from generative AI models for correctness. Another area that Project CodeNet addressed is the quality of the data samples. From a paper by Allamanis, we learned that quite a large number of frequently used AI for Code datasets have duplicate or near-duplicate code samples, which can inflate performance metrics as much as 100%. In addition, we found that problem-submission style datasets from online judging systems can contain clusters of identical problems, which will certainly skew the performance metrics. One example is POJ-104, in which problems 26 and 62 are identical. Therefore we identified the near-duplicates and the identical problem clusters in Project CodeNet and provide these information for the benefit of the users.",https://www.ibm.com/academic/topic/artificial-intelligence?ach_id=c8e5aa3a-f0b4-4a20-b469-e3f807f8a849

This allows a consumer of the model to determine if it is appropriate for their situation. AI Governance enables an enterprise to specify and enforce policies describing how an AI model or service should be constructed and deployed. This can prevent undesirable situations, such as a model training with unapproved datasets, models having biases, or models having unexpected performance variations.Increasing AI transparency and improving AI Governance are two important use cases for the FactSheet project. We now focus on key ideas that are common to both use cases.",https://www.ibm.com/academic/topic/artificial-intelligence?ach_id=4374a44e-6017-4d13-9d9c-c5ab9e2226e6 
Artificial Intelligence,Software,Adversarial Robustness Toolbox,"Security and privacy of our AI training data and models is one of the key pillars for building trust in AI. As machine learning and AI models grow with increasing sophistication and accuracy, they are making their way into more and more applications and processes that govern our daily lives. Our increased reliance on these models and the value they represent as an accumulation of confidential and proprietary knowledge, are at increasing risk for attack. Further, these models pose unique security risks that must be accounted for and mitigated. The Adversarial Robustness Toolbox is here to help. The Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART) is a Python library for machine learning security. ART provides tools that enable developers and researchers to evaluate and defend machine learning models and applications against the adversarial threats of evasion, poisoning, extraction, and inference.
